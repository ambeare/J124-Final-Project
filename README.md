# Final Project for Amber Ellertson

### J124 Intro to Data Journalism - Jeremy Rue

#### By Amber Ellertson 

The dataset I chose focused on crashes and fatalities among all airlines in the world from 1985 to 1999 and 2000 to 2014. This data proved to be rather interesting, as many more non-US based airlines experienced higher levels of fatalities than US based ones. I also thought it was interesting how the airline that had the least amount of non-fatal incidents from 1985-1999 was Cathay Pacific, a Hong Kong based airline, but from 2000-2014, Cathay Pacific had dropped to #20. This progress over the years raises questions regarding airline technology and its effect on safety, as well as how pilot training has changed over the years (and how that may differ based on the country). This same point regarding disparities based on location is only magnified when further interrogating the data; China Arilines had the greatest number of fatalities from 1985-1999 at 535 and Malaysia Airlines had the highest number of fatalities from 2000-2014 at 537, but Kenya Airways had the least amount of fatalities from 1985-1999 while Southwest Airlines had the least amount of fatalities from 2000-2014. These changes based on region indicate a significant disparity between level of safety and location, as the US, a more developed country, has been deemed the safest airline in the world based on this data, while Malaysia Airlines, a foreign airline based in a relatively underdeveloped country has been deemed the most dangerous airline in the world based on this data. This conclusion can be dangerous, though, as this data could be used by some to reinforce stereotypes regarding safety in non-Anglo regions of the world.

It should also be noted that Kenya Airways was ranked the most safe airline from 1985-1999, but it then dropped to #54 with 283 fatalities from 2000-2014. This raises questions regarding whether the data is truly accurate or not, and if it is, it asks why the significant drop over the years in safety from a seemingly safe airline? One can only wonder what the levels of conflict, poverty, corruption, and any other negative impacts on the economy must have been for this airline to experience such a fall from grace.

Another interesting (albeit terrifying) fact about the data is that there has been a significant increase in fatalities across the globe from 2000-2014 versus 1985-1999. This may be due to a lack of accessible data spanning from that many years ago, but it is still an interesting thought to ponder.
